# Tictactoe
A web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where two players take turns clicking on a 3x3 grid to place their marks (X or O). The game checks for a winner after each move and displays the result (win or tie) with colorful feedback. It is interactive, responsive, and visually styled for a better user experience.
